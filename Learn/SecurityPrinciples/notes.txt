SECURITY TRIAD (CIA):
CONFIDENTIALITY: ensures that only the intended persons or recipients can access the data.
INTEGRITY: aims to ensure that the data cannot be altered; moreover, we can detect any alteration if it occurs.
AVAILABILITY: aims to ensure that the system or service is available when needed.

BEYOND CIA:
AUTHENTICITY: means not fraudulent or counterfeit. Is about ensuring that the document/file/data is from the claimed source.
NONREPUDIATION: means refusing to recognize the validity of something. Ensures that the original source cannot deny that they are the source of a particular document/file/data.

UTILITY: focuses on the usefulness of the information.
POSSESSION: requires that we protect the information from unauthorized taking, copying, or controlling.

MEANS OF ATTACK (DAD):
DISCLOSURE: is the opposite of confidentiality.
ALTERATION: is the opposite of integrity.
DESTRUCTION/DENIAL: is the opposite of availability.

Bell-LaPadula MODEL: aims to achieve confidentiality.
SIMPLE SECURITY PROPERTY: referred to as "no read up"; it states that a subject of a lower security level cannot read an object of a higher security level.
    This rule prevents access to sensitive information above the authorized level.

STAR SECURITY PROPERTY: referred to "no write down"; it states that a subject at a higher security level cannot write to an object at a lower security level.
    This rule prevents the disclosure of sensitive information to a subject of lower security level.

DISCRETION-SECURITY PROPERTY: uses an access matrix to allow read and write operations.

Biba MODEL: aims to achieve integrity.
SIMPLE INTEGRITY PROPERTY: referred to as "no read down".
    A higher integrity subject should not read from a lower integrity object.

STAR INTEGRITY PROPERTY: referred as "no write up".
    A lower integrity subject should not write to a higher integrity object.
 
Clark-Wilson MODEL: aims to achieve integrity.
CONSTRAINED DATA ITEM (CDI): refers to the data type whose integrity we want to preserve.

UNCONSTRAINED DATA ITEM (UDI): referes to all data types beyond CDI.
    Such as user and system input.

INTEGRITY VERIFICATION PROCEDURES (IVPs): check and ensure the validity of CDIs.
